Options:
Each personnel has options to make entries for each of them
Each cabinet
The currency operations are crypted as crypto currencies for each year
At the new year, information for next to last year is removed
Enterprise field is not stored, but tables start with enterpriseName + year + _ <name>
Think how to arrange the database storage so that nobody having the physical access to the database
is not able to decrypt it:
A person has all amounts related to it in its device, so it does not need the financial information
A person's device sends all information as encrypted messages, which nobody is able to read
These encrypted messages are stored at the server, manager just reads those encrypted messages from
each user and encrypts on his own computer.
The manager has its own storages on its own computers, optionally encrypted on his google disk or
another disk.
He separately has a key to those encryption, encoded with a password and stored on other devices (maybe on 
the flash or other means of storage).
