    Data:

     h = hand (haslo)
     k = suggested hash key
     n = serial number code
    Encoding params: PRIMARY HANDSHAKE KEY (server: for specific VERSION, client: hdkey)
                     PRIMARY SIGN-IN ID (server: for specific VERSION, client: signIn)
    Expected logic: if "n" is the same, the customer point entry is rewritten, if "n" is different
        the oldest customer point entry is rewritten if the number of entries >=N (for example, 50) for specific VERSION
        and the error is thrown, if the number of such rewrites is more than M per day (for example, 20) for specific VERSION

   ["Encoded block"]
   Special cases: if "Encoded block" contains spaces, it is a user message of error
                  if "Encoded block" is less than 128 without spaces, it is a code of error 
          Also if the format is different, it is a system error
          ["LOGIN"] means the login/ password wrong 
          All other errors mean the system error and it means
            "Check your network and repeat your request in some time"

     rfrKey = hash key for second handshake
