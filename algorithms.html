Access to the saving site is thru the Authorization bearer token
1. the public and private certificate are placed at the site in the protected place
2. in mobile/ desktop applications we should find the way to store data persistently
the user enters login/password and receives a token - prepare this api
write in php api which can have a new token
It should contain 3 important fields
userId(string), rightMask(number), userName(alias), gallery(string)
gallery is defined as follows:
 1) by user data (should be able to change it)
 2) by first gallery created by this person
 3) in the default place
3.this token is persistently saved in all applications
4. everything high-secret stored is hash encoded by a specific constant key
5. token is issued for 12 hours
6. Good approach: every (non web) application generates its own private/public key
   private is saved in the storage,
   public is sent together with user/password and stored in the backend
   
   every time the user starts an application, dart application checks the token,
  if it is expired or about to be expired, it sends privately encoded userId and time and receives
  the token in response, which is temporarily saved    

Temporary solution:
generate 512 byte key
make encoding: 
 1. first 256 bytes are to be non-repeative for placement, next 256 bytes are for xor operations
 2. generation algorithm is as follows:
    a) generate 512 random bytes
    b) the first 256 bytes are considered as follows:
       b1) finding digits which are not used yet and make them in arbitrary order
       b2) looking again, and if any digit is already met, it is replaced by any digit from that arbitrary order
 3. algorithm of encoding is as follows:
    1 byte of front padding, 1 byte of back padding,front padding, 1 byte of encoding, 4byteid,10byte customer spec word,  data, back padding
  the total must be dividable by 256
  then data is converted as above and the result is base64 encoded
  the transfer to the server is
