Access to the saving site is thru the Authorization bearer token
1. the public and private certificate are placed at the site in the protected place
2. in mobile/ desktop applications we should find the way to store data persistently
the user enters login/password and receives a token - prepare this api
write in php api which can have a new token
It should contain 3 important fields
userId(string), rightMask(number), userName(alias), gallery(string)
gallery is defined as follows:
 1) by user data (should be able to change it)
 2) by first gallery created by this person
 3) in the default place
3.this token is persistently saved in all applications
4. everything high-secret stored is hash encoded by a specific constant key
5. token is issued for 12 hours
6. Good approach: every (non web) application generates its own private/public key
   private is saved in the storage,
   public is sent together with user/password and stored in the backend
   
   every time the user starts an application, dart application checks the token,
  if it is expired or about to be expired, it sends privately encoded userId and time and receives
  the token in response, which is temporarily saved    

Temporary solution:
generate 4096-based key
the host supposes the range between 10-24, with the default to 14. 
make encoding: 
 1. first base bytes are to be non-repeative for permutation, next base bytes are for xor transformation
 2. the user has the option to increase the base up to 20-degree. So, his choise is 10..20 with the default of 14
 3. algorithm of encoding is as follows:
    1 byte of front padding, 1 byte of back padding,front padding, 1 byte of encoding, 4byteid,10byte customer spec word,  data, back padding
  the total must be dividable by base
  then data is converted as above and the result is base64 encoded
When a user comes, he has a password and depending on the password, his communication can be on some
levels of security

Login: POST <host and path>lg.php
 User
 Password
 new generated id inside,
 new generated key, everything is encoded inside  {"real user", "pass": "real password"} json-encoded by json screening of \ and "
 user and pass are space truncated, 
 all \ and " can be simply removed from the user's name
 RESPONSE: if everything is ok the result is a positive number - its additional number
           if not, the result will be 0 or any other  ["123"] - positive reply, ["0"] - error
The device stores the response (code) the id and the key at its side 

Next communication is as follows:
    POST <host and path>cm.php
    where body is as follows:
    h=code&m=encoded task

    the first encoded task is storing a post with audio/video/image/text
